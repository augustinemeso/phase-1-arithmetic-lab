// 1. Create a variable called multiply set to an equation that will multiply the variables num1 and num2; the result of the multiplication should be 62.
let num1 = 31;
let num2 = 2;
let multiply = num1 * num2; // Result should be 62

// 2. Create a variable called random that will generate a random integer greater than 0.
let random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1; // Generates a random integer between 1 and 100

// 3. Create a variable called mod set to an equation that will calculate the remainder of dividing variable num3 by num4; the remainder should be 4.
let num3 = 28;
let num4 = 6;
let mod = num3 % num4; // Result should be 4

// 4. Create a variable called max that finds the highest number in a set; the value returned should be 20.
let max = Math.max(5, 10, 15, 20); // Finds the highest number in the set
